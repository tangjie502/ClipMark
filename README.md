ClipMark is a powerful browser extension that helps you save web content in clean, formatted Markdown. Forked from the excellent [MarkDownload](https://github.com/deathau/markdownload/) extension, ClipMark has been updated to Manifest V3 to comply with Chrome Extension Store requirements while adding enhanced features like improved table formatting, cleaner code blocks, and better overall readability.

## Features

- Clean article extraction using Mozilla's Readability.js
- Accurate HTML to Markdown conversion with Turndown
- Pretty-printed tables with customizable formatting (new)
- Enhanced code block handling with language detection
- Image downloading and management
- Obsidian integration
- Extensive context menu options
- Batch URL processing for converting multiple pages at once (new)
- Customizable front/back matter templates
- Dark mode support

## For Developers

As a developer, documentation is crucial to your workflow. ClipMark streamlines the process of saving technical documentation for use with Large Language Models (LLMs) and other development tools:

- **One-Click Documentation Export**: Instead of manually copying sections of API documentation, code examples, and explanations, capture entire documentation pages with a single click - complete with proper code block formatting and syntax highlighting.

- **LLM-Ready Format**: The clean Markdown output is perfect for feeding into LLMs for code assistance, making it easier to work with AI tools while coding.

- **Code Block Preservation**: All code snippets are automatically detected and preserved in fenced code blocks with proper language tags, maintaining syntax highlighting and formatting.

- **Batch Processing**: When researching multiple technologies, use the "Download All Tabs" feature to quickly save entire documentation sets as separate Markdown files.

- **Table Handling**: Technical specifications and API parameter tables are converted with clean formatting, making them easy to reference or process programmatically.
